A simple responsive mortgage calculator widget.

== Description ==

The Responsive Mortgage Calculator is a jQuery widget that's designed to fit easily into any theme, on any device, at any size. Just what every "Real Estate Agent on the go" needs.

__Features__

The calculator allows your website visitors to estimate their mortgage entering:
* the total cost of the of the home,
* a down payment amount,
* an interested rate (fixed rate),
* the amortization period
* and they can select a payment period, either monthly, bi-weekly, or weekly.

The payment result is displayed below the form - very simply and very easy to follow. But for the savvy user, a click on the information icon reveals more details…

__Redesign It__

The widget is built with plenty of classes to hook into for styling, so it’s easy to override the included stylesheet.

= DISCLAIMER =

I do not vouch for the accuracy of this mortgage calculator and any results. It's pretty darn good, but the bank has the final say...

The calculator is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect actual numbers for your mortgage. 
Assumes constant interest rate throughout amortization period; interest calculated semi-annually.

== Screenshots ==

1. The mortgage calculator fits in the widgets area of your theme and blends right in. The form inputs are styled simply and unobtrusively. The ‘Calculate’ button takes it’s styling from your theme.
2. The mortgage payment amount is displayed below the ‘Calculate’ button. The circled ‘i’ - the ‘inspector’ icon for Mac fans - is clickable.
3. A longer summary of the mortgage details is displayed when the ‘inspector’ icon is clicked.
